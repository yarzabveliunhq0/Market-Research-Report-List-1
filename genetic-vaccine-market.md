<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Genetic Vaccine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Recombinant Protein Vaccine</li><li>Gene-Based Vaccine</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The genetic vaccine market primarily comprises two types: recombinant protein vaccines and gene-based vaccines. Recombinant protein vaccines are developed by inserting genetic material encoding specific proteins from pathogens into host cells, leading to an immune response without using live pathogens. In contrast, gene-based vaccines directly deliver genetic material—such as DNA or RNA—into host cells, prompting them to produce pathogen-specific antigens themselves. Both approaches harness genetic technology to enhance vaccine efficacy and safety against various diseases.</p></p>
